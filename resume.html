            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-9 mt-2">
              <p>The following is a summary of my work history along with some narrative for each role:</p>
              <h4>OpenGov</h4>
              <p><u><em>Product Manager</em></u><span class="resume-dot"><strong>&bull;</strong></span><u>August 2019 - March 2020 (Laid off due to Covid-19)</u></p>
              <p>Oversaw the Reporting and Analysis product line. Helped shepherd the NextGen Reporting through general
                availability. Solicited key customers and stakeholders for requirements and design feedback. Worked closely
                with the engineering team to deliver on critical features and initiatives.</p>
              <h4>Granicus</h4>
              <p><em><u>Product Manager</u></em><span class="resume-dot"><strong>&bull;</strong></span><u>July 2010 - August 2019</u></p>
              <p>Inheriting a suite of existing SaaS products aimed at making the public meeting process for local government
                clerks and elected officials more transparent and efficient, I oversaw a complete rewrite of the suite
                including a backend technology upgrade and user interface refresh when I first started in my product
                management role. No small feat! Today, this product line is worth several million dollars in annual recurring
                revenue.</p>
              <p>After a successful launch and eventual 100% client adoption of the aforementioned product suite, I was tasked
                with shepherding a brand new product for streamlining the citizen application process for local boards and
                commissions from a beta phase to full release. Working closely with clients and internal Granicus teams, this
                included overseeing the development of several new modules as well as many features and fixes. This product is
                also what sparked my desire to learn code skills. Many of my bug fixes and feature requests are still in the
                codebase!</p>
              <p>Most recently and due to my past product successes, I took over product management duties for a product suite
                Granicus inherited in an acquisition. Automating the document recording, indexing, and public search process
                for county clerks and recorders, the product suite accounts for a significant portion of recurring revenue,
                but has been languishing due to an aging tech stack and outdated user interface. Gathering and analyzing data
                for total addressable market, competitive landscape, revenue growth projections, profit, and costs, I put
                together a holistic product view for the CEO and executive team to make an informed decision about how to move
                forward with the product line.</p>
              <p><em><u>Deployment Technician</u></em><span class="resume-dot"><strong>&bull;</strong></span><u>January 2010 - July 2010</u></p>
              <p>Working with customers both onsite and remotely, I deployed new hardware and software installations. Blending
                technical, communication, project management, and interpersonal skills, I ramped up quickly and was successful
                from the start due to my previous experience in customer success. Alas, while I enjoyed my responsibilities, I
                was not in the deployment world for very long.</p>
              <p>After demonstrating my aptitude for product management through side projects outside of my main duties in
                this role as well as my previous one at Granicus, I was promoted to be the first formal product manager at
                Granicus on the newly formed PM team!</p>
              <p><em><u>Customer Success Manager</u></em><span class="resume-dot"><strong>&bull;</strong></span><u>August 2008 - January 2010</u></p>
              <p>My first role in my Granicus journey was serving as the primary point of contact for the ever-expanding
                Pacific region of clients. When customers needed help, they contacted me. Handling non-technical questions
                with training guidance as well as the occasional frustrated client with gentle guidance, being responsible for
                the overall success and happiness of our clients was a duty I relished and took pride in doing. As I got a few
                months further into my tenure, I started tackling my own support and design cases after-hours rather than
                passing them along to other internal teams. It was during this time that I augmented my communication and
                training skillset with technical aptitude.</p>
              <p>An internal decision was made to re-focus the success team at up-selling existing clients, which was not
                quite the direction I wanted to go. Recognizing my blend of skills and desire to continue to build my
                technical knowledge, my manager promoted me to the deployment team.</p>
              <h4>Marketing Designs</h4>
              <p><em><u>Copy Editor</u></em><span class="resume-dot"><strong>&bull;</strong></span><u>June 2007 - August 2008</u></p>
              <p>My post-college career path began with a job in copy editing, which requires the utmost attention to detail.
                I was responsible for catching any and all errors on special marketing materials we produced for real estate
                agents serving the high end of the Bay Area real estate market (read: multi-million dollar homes). I kept an
                eye out for spelling and grammatical errors of course, but I also became quite adept at spotting design issues
                like alignment and missing elements. I achieved a 99.7% accuracy rate on over 2,000 printed projects
                (calculated based on the number of projects that had to be reprinted due to an error I missed). Pretty darn
                good, eh?</p>
